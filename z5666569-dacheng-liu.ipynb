    "## Assignment 1: Constraint Satisfaction Search\n",
    "\n",
    "@Authors: **Wayne Wobcke, Alfred Krzywicki, Stefano Mezza**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due Date:** Week 5, Friday, October 17, 5.00pm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment concerns developing optimal solutions to a scheduling problem inspired by the scenario of a manufacturing plant that has to fulfil multiple customer orders with varying deadlines, but where there may be constraints on tasks and on relationships between tasks. Any number of tasks can be scheduled at the same time, but it is possible that some tasks cannot be finished before their deadline. A task finishing late is acceptable, however incurs a cost, which for this assignment is a simple (dollar) amount per hour that the task is late.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *fuzzy scheduling* problem in this scenario is simplified by ignoring customer orders and having just one machine and a number of *tasks*, each with a fixed duration in hours. Each task must start and finish on the same day, within working hours (9am to 5pm). In addition, there can be *constraints*, both on single tasks and between two tasks. One type of constraint is that a task can have a deadline, which can be “hard” (the deadline must be met in any valid schedule) or “soft” (the task may be finished late &ndash; though still at or before 5pm &ndash; but with a “cost” per hour for missing the deadline). The aim is to develop an overall schedule for all the tasks (in a single week) that minimizes the total cost of all the tasks that finish late, provided that all the hard constraints on tasks are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "More technically, this assignment is an example of a *constraint optimization problem* (or *constrained optimization problem*), a problem that has constraints like a standard Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), but also a *cost* associated with each solution. For this assignment, we will use a *greedy* algorithm to find optimal solutions to fuzzy scheduling problems that are specified as text strings. However, unlike the greedy search algorithm described in the lectures on search, this greedy algorithm has the property that it is guaranteed to find an optimal solution for any problem (if a solution exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will use the AIPython code of Poole & Mackworth. You are given code to translate fuzzy scheduling problems specified as text strings into CSPs with a cost, and you are given code for several constraint solving algorithms &ndash; based on domain splitting and arc consistency, and based on depth-first search. The assignment will be to implement some missing procedures and to analyse the performance of the constraint solving methods, both analytically and experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is an individual assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your answers in **this** notebook and submit **this** notebook on Moodle under **Assignment 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name your submission ``<zid>-<firstname>-<lastname>.ipynb`` where ``<firstname>-<lastname>`` is your **real** (not Moodle) name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you set up AIPython (as done below) so the code can be run on either CSE machines or a marker's own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not submit any AIPython code. Hence do not change any AIPython code to make your code run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure your notebook runs cleanly (restart the kernel, clear all outputs and run each cell to check).\n",
    "\n",
    "- After checking that your notebook runs cleanly, run all cells and submit the notebook **with** the outputs included (do not submit the empty version).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure images (for plots/graphs) are **included** in the notebook you submit (sometimes images are saved on your machine but are not in the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not modify the existing code in this notebook except to answer the questions. Marks will be given as and where indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to submit additional code (e.g. for generating plots), add that at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important: Do not distribute any of this code on the Internet. This includes ChatGPT. Do not put this assignment into any LLM.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Late Penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard UNSW late penalties apply (5% of the value of the assignment per day or part day late).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Unlike the CSE systems, there is no grace period on Moodle. The due date and time is 5pm **precisely** on Friday October 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: You can submit as many times as you want before the due date, but if you do submit before the due date, you cannot submit on Moodle after the due date. If you do not submit before the due date, you can submit on Moodle after the due date.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plagiarism\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that ALL work submitted for this assignment must be your own work and no sharing or copying of code or answers is allowed. You may discuss the assignment with other students but must not collaborate on developing answers to the questions. You may use code from the Internet only with suitable attribution of the source. You may not use ChatGPT or any similar software to generate any part of your explanations, evaluations or code. Do not use public code repositories on sites such as github or file sharing sites such as Google Drive to save any part of your work &ndash; make sure your code repository or cloud storage is private and do not share any links. This also applies after you have finished the course, as we do not want next year’s students accessing your solution, and plagiarism penalties can still apply after the course has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "All submitted assignments will be run through plagiarism detection software to detect similarities to other submissions, including from past years. You should **carefully** read the UNSW policy on academic integrity and plagiarism (linked from the course web page), noting, in particular, that collusion (working together on an assignment, or sharing parts of assignment solutions) is a form of plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, do not use any contract cheating “academies” or online “tutoring” services. This counts as serious misconduct with heavy penalties up to automatic failure of the course with 0 marks, and expulsion from the university for repeat offenders."

    "### Fuzzy Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSP for this assignment is a set of variables representing tasks, binary constraints on pairs of tasks, and unary constraints (hard or soft) on tasks. The domains are all the working hours in one week, and a task duration is in hours. Days are represented (in the input and output) as strings ‘mon’, ‘tue’, ‘wed’, ‘thu’ and ‘fri’, and times are represented as strings ‘9am’, ‘10am’, ‘11am’, ‘12pm’, ‘1pm’, ‘2pm’, ‘3pm’, ‘4pm’ and ‘5pm’. The only possible values for the start and end times of a task are combinations of a day and times, e.g. ‘mon 9am’. Each task name is a string (with no spaces), and the only soft constraints are the soft deadline constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Constraints:** These specify a hard requirement for the relationship between two tasks.\n",
    "- **Hard Domain Constraints:** These specify hard requirements for the tasks themselves.\n",
    "- **Soft Deadline Constraints:** These constraints specify that a task may finish late, but with a given cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each soft constraint has a function defining the *cost* associated with violating the preference, that the constraint solver must minimize, while respecting all the hard constraints. The *cost* of a solution is simply the sum of the costs for the soft constraints that the solution violates (and is always a non-negative integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the list of possible constraints for a fuzzy scheduling problem (comments below are for explanation and do **not** appear in the input specification; however, the code we supply *should* work with comments that take up a full line): \n",

    "**Search spaces**  \n",
    "In these scheduling CSPs, the start state is the set of all task domains (possible start times).  \n",
    "1. For the DFS solver, the successor function assigns a value to the next unassigned task.  \n",
    "2. For the domain splitting with arc consistency solver, the successor function splits a variable’s domain into two parts and then prunes other domains by enforcing arc consistency.  \n",
    "The goal state is reached when all tasks have single values that satisfy the hard constraints; soft constraints only affect the cost.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Branching factor and maximum depth**  \n",
    "Let \\(n\\) be the number of tasks and \\(d\\) the maximum domain size.  \n",
    "1. DFS has a branching factor of about \\(d\\) and a maximum depth of \\(n\\).  \n",
    "2. Domain splitting with AC has a branching factor of 2, and maximum depth is about \\(O(n \\log d)\\), since domains can be repeatedly split.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and space complexity**  \n",
    "1. DFS has worst-case time \\(O(d^n)\\) and space \\(O(n)\\) (depth of the search tree).  \n",
    "2. Domain splitting with AC requires arc consistency checks (about \\(O(e d^2)\\), where \\(e\\) is the number of constraints). Combined with splitting depth, this gives about \\(O(e d^2 n \\log d)\\). Space is \\(O(nd)\\), to store domains.  \n",

    "1. DFS would still assign t1 = Mon, then explore values for t2 before finding a conflict.  \n",
    "2. With domain splitting + AC, the same-day constraint would immediately wipe out t2’s domain, showing no solution.  \n",

    "### 1. Worst-case time and space complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "- **n** = number of tasks (variables)\n",
    "- **d** = maximum domain size (possible start times per task)\n",
    "- **e** = number of binary constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**DFS (plain backtracking):**\n",
    "- **Time:** O(d^n) in the worst case (enumerates all assignments).\n",
    "- **Space:** O(n) for the recursion stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DFS-MRV (with forward checking):**\n",
    "- **Time:** Still exponential, roughly O(d^n), but with per-node cost of domain filtering O(e·d) to O(e·d²).  \n",
    "  A conservative bound: **O(d^n · e · d)**.\n",
    "- **Space:** O(n + n·d) (recursion stack plus domain copies/updates).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Properties of the algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Completeness:** Both DFS and DFS-MRV are complete for finite CSPs; if a solution exists, they will eventually find one.  \n",
    "- **Optimality:** Ignoring costs, neither is an optimization algorithm. They return a satisfying assignment, not necessarily the one with the lowest cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Example where DFS-MRV is easier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**  \n",
    "- Tasks t2, t3, t4 are all constrained to be on the same day with very tight time windows.  \n",
    "- Task t1 has a very large domain with no restrictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**DFS:** May assign t1 first, explore many useless values, and only later discover that t2–t4 cannot be jointly satisfied.  \n",
    "**DFS-MRV:** Picks the most constrained variable first (t2 or t3), immediately propagates through forward checking, and detects inconsistency early.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why easier:** MRV focuses search on the bottleneck variables and forward checking prunes infeasible options sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Empirical comparison: first solution quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protocol:**\n",
    "1. Generate random CSP instances for various n (e.g., 3–8 tasks).  \n",
    "2. Run DFS to get the **first solution**, then evaluate its cost.  \n",
    "3. Run DFS-MRV to get the **first solution**, then evaluate its cost.  \n",

    "\n",

    "### 5. Empirical comparison: nodes expanded\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protocol:**\n",
    "1. For the same random instances, count the number of nodes expanded by DFS and DFS-MRV.  \n",
    "2. Average results across multiple trials per n.  \n",

    "### Experimental Setup\n",
    "We compared two CSP solvers:\n",
    "- **Plain DFS Solver**: chooses variables in a fixed order and explores all values without considering costs.  \n",
    "- **Cost-Guided DFS Solver**: chooses variables based on the minimum estimated cost (lateness × penalty) and orders values in increasing cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance metric is the **average number of nodes expanded** until solutions are found.  \n",
    "Experiments were conducted on randomly generated problems of varying sizes `n` (number of tasks), with both hard constraints and soft deadline constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- For small-scale problems (e.g., `n=2`), the plain DFS solver often found the first solution more quickly, expanding fewer nodes. For example:  \n",
    "  - **Plain DFS**: first solution at ~5 nodes, total ~125 expansions.  \n",
    "  - **DFS with cost**: first solution at ~130 nodes, total ~250 expansions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- For larger problems with more diverse deadlines, the cost-guided solver sometimes expanded fewer nodes on average, as the heuristic could prune infeasible or high-cost branches earlier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- However, the heuristic is **not admissible**: it does not always guide the search toward the most efficient path. In some cases, it introduces overhead and explores more nodes than plain DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Completeness**: Both solvers are complete (they will find a solution if one exists).  \n",
    "- **Optimality**: Neither DFS variant guarantees optimality; however, cost guidance tends to bias the search toward solutions closer to deadline constraints.  \n",
    "- **Performance Trade-offs**:  \n",
    "  - When deadlines are uniform or do not strongly influence feasibility, the cost heuristic provides little benefit and can increase search overhead.  \n",
    "  - When deadlines vary significantly, the cost-guided solver reduces the search space and achieves fewer node expansions.  \n",
